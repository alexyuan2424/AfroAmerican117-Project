        <h2>Connection to "We Wear the Mask"</h2>
         <p><font size = "4">
            Victims of sexual misconduct are forced to live their lives in a psychological prison. These people must conceal their pain and suffering in order to continue the lives they are living, effectively wearing a mask.
             <h3 text><i>"We Wear the Mask that Grins and Lies"</i></h3>
            <p>The Metoo movement has allowed these individuals to “take off their masks”, but in doing so often comes pain and consequence. </p>
