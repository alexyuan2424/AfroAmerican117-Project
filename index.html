        <h4>About the Poet</h4>
        <p>
            Paul Laurence Dunbar, born June 27 1872, was an African American poet of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was the child of two free African American parents from Kentucky, who heavily influenced his early writings about plantation life. Dunbar is widely considered the first professional poet in African American literary tradition. Through his writings, Dunbar became associated with black leaders such as Booker T. Washington, James D. Corrothers, and Frederick Douglass, who he served as a secretary to.

            Dunbars numerous collection of writings and poetry had a significant impact on postbellum America. Dunbars ideas also apply to the many ongoing issues in present day America. By writing poems in both dialect and “standard english”, Dunbar was able to communicate his messages to a wide range of audiences in early America. A popular theme in his poems was African American culture and the struggles African Americans faced in postbellum America. These themes were depicted in a variety of ways, whether it was with humor in “An ante-bellum Sermon”, or in a more serious tone in “Frederick Douglass. “We Wear the Mask”, one of Dunbar's most popular and important poems, conveys a message that spoke to postbellum issues, and 21st century issues in America.

            In this poem, “We Wear the Mask”, Dunbar describes the “racial disguise” that African Americans are forced do and deal with. He talks about how society puts African Americans in a situation where they are not allowed to be themselves and express how they truly feel. Dunbar says that in order to get by, African Americans frequently conceal their pain and frustration from whites. African Americans are forced to wear a mask, as if they revealed their true feelings publicly, their would be serious consequences.
